Ruby, a Discord bot
======

This bot was made specifically for the ~Nyaa network servers and contains many features that only pertain to those servers.

This is largely a rewrite of the original bot-- The original code can be found in the legacy branch of this repository.

The focuses of this update will be more Object-Oriented Programming and making the code more readable and consistent in terms of formatting. The features of the old bot will all remain, if not be improved.
Additionally, a new database system is being worked on that will add additional new features to the bot.

Making the bot more modular and easier to modify on the fly is a really big focus, all for the simplification for the future.

A lot of old features that were created specifically for other servers (CoreCraft) will be removed and moved to a different bot. This is to keep Ruby's code as the network bot as clean as possible (In fact, they will be removed from those other servers in favour for the new bot with the features they need).
